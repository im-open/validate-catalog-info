As such no repository outside of this one should define these.\r\rSystem entities that make up our \"current state\" are connected to Domain entities via the `spec.domain` attribute.\r\rOnce a Component, Resource, or API is created to implement a Domain, a System entity should be created.\r\rMore @ https://techhub.mktp.io/docs/default/system/techhub/catalog-info-entities/domain/ .",
