  "description": "Like Domain entities, System entities are a little different than other entity types. Most of them represent bounded contexts, and will therefore \"contain\" Component, API, and Resource entities via those entities spec.system property. There are a few Systems that will be outside of our bounded context model however. These Systems will include things like TechHub, pipeline tooling, and anything else of a nonfunctional nature (authentication, observability, infrastructure systems, etc.).\r\rOnce a Component, Resource, or API is created to implement a Domain, a System entity should be created and linked to that Domain with the spec.domain property (see below).\r\rMore info @ https://techhub.mktp.io/docs/default/system/techhub/catalog-info-entities/system/ .",
